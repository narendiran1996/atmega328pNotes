\section{Data Transfer and Frame Format}

\subsection{Transferring Bits}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{i2cTransferBits.png}
\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each data bit transferred is done by a pulse on clock line.
    \item Level of data line must be stable when the clock line is high.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{START and STOP Conditions}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{i2cSTARTSTOP.png}
\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Both \iicFormat{START} and \iicFormat{STOP} conditions are done by changing \pinFormat{SDA} line when \pinFormat{SCL} is kept high.
	\item Master initiates transmission by issuing a \iicFormat{START} condition.
	\item Master terminates transmission by issuing a \iicFormat{STOP} condition.
	\item Between \iicFormat{START} and \iicFormat{STOP}, bus is busy and no other master should try to control bus.
	\item The same master however can issue \iicFormat{REPEATED START}(same as \iicFormat{START}) to initiate a new transfer.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Address Packet format}
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{i2cAddressPacketFormat}
        \end{center}
    \end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Addresses packets(\iicFormat{SLA}) are 9-bit long.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 7 address bits with MSB transmitted first
		\item one READ(1)/WRITE(0) control bit indicating the transmitter or receiver mode respectively
		\item one acknowledge bit by the Slave	
	\end{itemize}	
	\item Would take 8 clock cycles by the master to send 7 address bits and one READ/WRITE control bit. \iicFormat{SLA+R} or \iicFormat{SLA+W}.
	\item On the 9th clock cycle, Master will leave out the control of \pinFormat{SDA} line (making it high due to pull-up resistor) but clocks out the 9th clock on the \pinFormat{SCL} line.
	\item On the 9th clock cycle, Slave recognizes that it is being addressed by pulling \pinFormat{SDA} line low making the \iicFormat{ACK}.
	\item If the Slave couldn’t for some reason respond, the \pinFormat{SDA} line remains high in the 9th clock cycle making the \iicFormat{NACK}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Packet format}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Data packetsare 9-bit long.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item one data byte - 8 bits with MSB first.
		\item one acknowledge bit by the master or slave depending the mode.
	\end{itemize}
	\item The transmitter(either the master or slave) send 8-bit data in 8 clock cycles.
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\begin{center}
			\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{i2cDataFrame}
		\end{center}
	\end{figure}
	\item On the 9th clock cycle, the transmitter will leave out the control of \pinFormat{SDA} line (making it high due to pull-up resistor).
	\item During the 9th clock cycle, the receiver pulls down the \pinFormat{SDA} line low to acknowledge the reception. – \iicFormat{ACK} is signaled by receiver.
	\item If the receiver doesn’t pull down the \pinFormat{SDA} line for some reason, then the \pinFormat{SDA} line remains high. – \iicFormat{NACK} is signaled by receiver.
	\item When the receiver received the last byte or can’t receive more byte, it should inform the transmitter by sending a \iicFormat{NACK}.
\end{itemize}

\section{TWI Module}
\subsection{Block Diagram}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{TWIModuleOVerview.png}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Bit Rate Generation Unit}
\begin{itemize}
    \item controls \pinFormat{SCL} line when in Master mode
    \item \bitFormat{TWBR} (TWI Bit Rate Generator) and Prescalar Bits in TWI status register \regFormat{TWSR} control \pinFormat{SCL}
    \item The \pinFormat{SCL} frequency can be
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
    $SCL frequency = \frac{CPU Clock Frequency}{16 + 2 * TWBR * Prescalar Value}$
\end{center}
\textbf{Note: } Slave’s clock frequency must be atleast 16 times higher than SCL frequency.

\subsection{Bus Interface Unit}
\begin{itemize}
    \item contains Data and adress Shift register - \regFormat{TWDR} register - address or data transmitted or received
    \item \iicFormat{START/STOP} Controller - Generates and detects \iicFormat{START}, \iicFormat{STOP} and \iicFormat{REPEATED START}
    \item Register Containing the \iicFormat{(N)ACK} to be transmitted or received
    \item Arbitration detection hardware.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Address Match Unit}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Received address bytes matches the seven-bit address in \regFormat{TWAR} (TWI Address register).
    \item address match results in informing the control unit
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Control Unit}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Monitors TWI bus and generates responses based on TWI control register (\regFormat{TWCR}).
    \item When a en even requires attention:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \bitFormat{TWINT} (TWI Interrupt flag ) is set 
        \item \regFormat{TWSR} (TWI Status Register) is updated with status code identifying the event.
        \item when the \bitFormat{TWINT} is set, the \pinFormat{SCL} line is held low.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \bitFormat{TWINT} flag is set If
    \begin{itemize}
        \item TWI has transmitted a \iicFormat{START/REPEATED START} condition
        \item TWI has transmitted \iicFormat{SLA+R/W}
        \item TWI has transmitted an address byte
        \item TWI has lost arbitration
        \item TWI has been addressed by own slave address or general call
        \item TWI has received a data bye
        \item \iicFormat{STOP} or \iicFormat{REPEATED START} has been received
        \item bus error occurred due to illegal \iicFormat{START} or \iicFormat{STOP}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{TWI Usage}
\begin{itemize}
    \item TWI is interrupt based and so \bitFormat{TWIE} bit in \regFormat{TWCR} register should be enabled; If the \bitFormat{TWIE} is diabled, then the \bitFormat{TWINT} flag must be polled.
    \item When the \bitFormat{TWINT} flag is asserted, TWI has finised operation and awaits for application response and \regFormat{TWSR} register describes the current status of TWI bus.
    \item Then, application should respond by manipulating the \regFormat{TWCR} and \regFormat{TWDR} register.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{An Example - Master transmits single data byte to slave}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{TWIExample.png}
\end{figure}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Transmission is started by writing specific value into \regFormat{TWCR} register to transmit the \iicFormat{START} condition. The \bitFormat{TWINT} flag is cleared by writing Loging HIGH which initiate the transmission of \iicFormat{START} condition.
    \item When the \iicFormat{START} condition has been transmitted, the TWINT flag in TWCR is set, and \regFormat{TWSR} is updated with a status code indicating that the \iicFormat{START} condition has successfully been sent.
    \item The application should now respond by examining the \regFormat{TWSR} register value. If status code is as expected, the application loads \iicFormat{SLA+W} into \regFormat{TWDR} and a specific value is written into \regFormat{TWCR} register to transmit the \iicFormat{SLA+W} present in \regFormat{TWDR}. The \bitFormat{TWINT} flag is cleared by writing logic HIGH which initiates the transmission of address packet.
    \item When the address packet has been transmitted, the \bitFormat{TWINT} flag in \regFormat{TWCR} is set, and \regFormat{TWSR} is updated with a status code indicating that the address packet has successfully been sent. The status code will also reflect whether a slave acknowledged the packet or not.
    \item The application should now respond by examining the \regFormat{TWSR} register value and \iicFormat{ACK} bit is as expected. If status code is as expected, the application loads Data packet into \regFormat{TWDR} and a specific value is written into \regFormat{TWCR} register to transmit the Data packet present in \regFormat{TWDR}. The \bitFormat{TWINT} flag is cleared by writing logic HIGH which initiates the transmission of data packet.
    \item When the data packet has been transmitted, the \bitFormat{TWINT} flag in \regFormat{TWCR} is set, and \regFormat{TWSR} is updated with a status code indicating that the data packet has successfully been sent. The status code will also reflect whether a slave acknowledged the packet or not.
    \item The application should now respond by examining the \regFormat{TWSR} register value and \iicFormat{ACK} bit is as expected. If status code is as expected, the application loads a specific value is written into \regFormat{TWCR} register to transmit the \iicFormat{STOP} Condition. The \bitFormat{TWINT} flag is cleared by writing logic HIGH which initiates the transmission of STOP condition.
